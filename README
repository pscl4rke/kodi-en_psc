What appears on my TV screen is rather a personal thing, and I like it
to be spelt properly.

This is a fork of the standard Kodi English language, with some things
updated to suit me better.  In particular:

* "Movie" → "Film"
* "TV Show" → "Box Set"
* "Season" → "Series"

Note that this doesn't fix the home screen, as skins like Confluence
have their own internationalisation embedded into them.
